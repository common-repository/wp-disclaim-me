WP-Disclaim-Me 0.3 (dominicfallows 18-Jun-2009)
* New: WYSIWYG editor on admin pages - using TinyMCE
* Update: CSS for Disclaimer content (front-end) left aligned by default, this can be changed with the WYSIWYG editor in the admin pages
* Update: When saving updated content, the page displays update status (Ok or error) but keeps the page visible so you don't have to re-navigate to the admin page
* BugFix: When updating/activated it will keep your current disclaimer contents
